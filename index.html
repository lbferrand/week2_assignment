    <h3>About the Book</h3>
    <p>
      Richly exploring one womanâ€™s poignant journey through life, All That
      Glitters is a compelling tale of challenges, heartbreak, discovery, and
      triumph, a powerful reminder that all that glitters is not the essence of
      life. And what is truly worth having was right there in our hands all
      along.
